              <div className="book-summary">This book completely shifted my perspective on habit formation. James Clear breaks down the science of how tiny, consistent changes can lead to massive transformations over time. It's not about willpower or motivation—it's about designing your environment and systems to make good habits inevitable. I found the practical strategies, like habit stacking and the two-minute rule, incredibly actionable. It's a must-read for anyone looking to build lasting positive changes in their life without feeling overwhelmed.</div>

              <div className="book-summary">Morgan Housel's book is a refreshing take on personal finance that focuses on behavior rather than strategies. He explores how people think about money through fascinating stories and insights, emphasizing that doing well with money has little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave. I loved the chapters on luck, risk, and the psychology behind financial decisions. It's not about getting rich quick; it's about understanding your own relationship with money to make better, more sustainable choices over a lifetime.</div>

              </a>
              <div className="book-summary">Rhonda Byrne's "The Secret" introduces the law of attraction in a way that's both intriguing and controversial. The core idea is that positive thoughts bring positive results, and the book is filled with anecdotes and teachings from various historical figures. While some parts feel a bit too mystical for my taste, it did spark some interesting reflections on mindset and intention. It's eye-opening in how it encourages visualizing success and gratitude, though I think it's most effective when balanced with practical action rather than taken as literal truth.</div>

              </a>
              <div className="book-summary">Daniel Goleman's classic on emotional intelligence was a game-changer for me. He argues that EQ is often more important than IQ for success in life and work. The book dives into self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills, backed by research and real-world examples. I appreciated how it made me reflect on my own emotional responses and interactions with others. It's not just theory—it's packed with practical advice for developing these skills, making it essential for personal and professional growth in today's interconnected world.</div>

              </a>
              <div className="book-summary">Josh Kaufman's "The Personal MBA" is like a crash course in business fundamentals without the hefty tuition. He distills complex concepts from marketing, finance, operations, and strategy into clear, actionable insights. What I loved most is how he emphasizes understanding the "why" behind business principles, making it accessible for entrepreneurs and anyone interested in thinking like a business owner. It's practical, no-nonsense, and has helped me approach projects and decisions with a more strategic mindset. A great read for building a solid foundation in business thinking.</div>
